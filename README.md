# An ARM-based OoO Superscalar (32-bit)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a **Superscalar LEG Processor with Simultaneous MultiThreading**. The processor is capable of processing **four threads** concurrently, with each thread able to execute **two instructions at a time**. Key architectural features include **Out-of-Order (OoO) execution**, **register renaming**, and a series of optimizations essential for efficient multithreaded processing.

## Updated LEGv8 ISA (32-bit) - Core Instructions

**R-Type (Register)**

ADD  Rd, Rn, Rm    // Rd = Rn + Rm
SUB  Rd, Rn, Rm    // Rd = Rn - Rm  
AND  Rd, Rn, Rm    // Rd = Rn & Rm
ORR  Rd, Rn, Rm    // Rd = Rn | Rm
XOR  Rd, Rn, Rm    // Rd = Rn ^ Rm
SLL  Rd, Rn, Rm    // Rd = Rn << Rm[4:0]
SRL  Rd, Rn, Rm    // Rd = Rn >> Rm[4:0] (logical)
SRA  Rd, Rn, Rm    // Rd = Rn >>> Rm[4:0] (arithmetic)

**I-Type (Immediate)**

ADDI Rd, Rn, imm   // Rd = Rn + imm
SUBI Rd, Rn, imm   // Rd = Rn - imm
ANDI Rd, Rn, imm   // Rd = Rn & imm
ORI  Rd, Rn, imm   // Rd = Rn | imm
XORI Rd, Rn, imm   // Rd = Rn ^ imm
SLLI Rd, Rn, imm   // Rd = Rn << imm[4:0]
SRLI Rd, Rn, imm   // Rd = Rn >> imm[4:0] (logical)
SRAI Rd, Rn, imm   // Rd = Rn >>> imm[4:0] (arithmetic)
LUI  Rd, imm       // Rd = {imm[15:0], 16'b0}

**D-Type (Load/Store)**

LDUR Rd, [Rn, imm] // Rd = memory[Rn + imm]
STUR Rd, [Rn, imm] // memory[Rn + imm] = Rd

**B-Type (Branch)**

B    label         // PC = PC + imm
CBZ  Rn, label     // if (Rn == 0) PC = PC + imm
CBNZ Rn, label     // if (Rn != 0) PC = PC + imm

## Total: 21 instructions 

## Key Features and Goals

### 1. **Multithreading and 2-Way Superscalar Execution**
- **Multithreading**: The processor will handle **two threads** simultaneously, with each thread running independently and processing its own instruction stream.
- **2-Way Superscalar**: Each thread is designed to fetch and execute **two instructions in parallel**, allowing a total of **4 instructions** to be processed per clock cycle across all threads.

### 2. **Out-of-Order (OoO) Execution**
The CPU supports **Out-of-Order (OoO)** execution to maximize performance by dynamically reordering instructions. Instructions are executed as soon as their operands are available, reducing pipeline stalls due to dependencies or earlier instructions.

### 3. **Register Renaming**
To handle **data hazards**, **register renaming** will be used. A set of physical registers will be allocated to avoid conflicts between multiple instructions executing in parallel, which helps resolve **WAR (Write-After-Read)** and **WAW (Write-After-Write)** hazards.

### 4. **Dynamic Instruction Scheduling**
- **Instruction Scheduling**: The CPU will use dynamic scheduling techniques like **Scoreboarding** or **Tomasuloâ€™s Algorithm** to track dependencies and ensure that ready instructions are executed while minimizing pipeline stalls.
- The processor will **analyze dependencies** and issue instructions that can be executed without conflicts in parallel.

### 5. **Dependency Management and Parallel Execution**
- **Instruction Fetch**: Instructions are fetched in parallel for each thread, keeping the pipeline full and ensuring maximum throughput.
- **Dependency Resolution**: The CPU analyzes instructions in each thread to determine **independent instructions** that can be executed in parallel. This avoids unnecessary stalling and ensures high utilization of resources.
- **Branch Prediction**: A branch prediction mechanism is included to minimize pipeline stalls from control hazards.

## Fetch and Execute Process

### Fetch Stage:
The processor fetches **two instructions per thread** in each cycle. The **instruction fetch unit** handles the program counter (PC) for each thread and updates it based on branch prediction outcomes. This keeps the pipeline filled with instructions, reducing stalls.

### Decode and Issue:
The CPU decodes instructions in parallel, identifying **instruction-level parallelism (ILP)** and determining if two instructions can execute simultaneously. Independent instructions are issued for execution immediately, while dependent instructions are held back until their operands are ready.

### Execute:
During execution, the **register renaming** mechanism ensures that instructions can use registers without conflicts. The CPU resolves **data hazards** using techniques like **bypassing** and **forwarding** to minimize pipeline stalls.

### Commit:
Instructions are **retired** in the correct order, with results being written back to the correct registers. **Precise exception handling** is ensured through this process.

## Conclusion

This project implements a state-of-the-art multithreaded, 2-way superscalar processor based on the LEGv8 architecture. Combining multithreading, superscalar execution, and advanced techniques like **OoO execution** and **register renaming**, the design aims to provide a high-performance processing solution capable of handling up to **eight instructions per cycle** across four threads.
